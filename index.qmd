# Preface {.unnumbered}

The R programming language [@R] can be fantastic for most daily tasks. But as soon as you start dealing with more complicated problems, you may face the for-loop bottle-neck. If you ever encounter such a problem, this book is for you. Applied HPC with R is a collection of talks and lectures I have given about speeding up your R code using parallel computing and other resources such as C++. The contents have been primarily developed during my time at USC and UofU.[^thanksto]
